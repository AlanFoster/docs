# Changelog

## 2015-04-02

All calls from a phone number to a Respoke endpoint now have callerId available. The callerId values can be accessed
via `call.callerId.number` for the phone number, and `call.callerId.name` for the descriptive name. If either value is
unavailable, it will be `null`.

Outgoing callerId has also been improved. When a role has only a single callerId configured, all outgoing phone calls
using that role will display that callerId by default. You can withhold your callerId by explicitly providing an empty
callerId param when calling `client.startPhoneCall()`.

For more information about callerId and phone calls using Respoke, visit the
"[Making Phone Calls](/tutorials/calling-to-and-from-a-phone.html)" article at the Respoke docs site.
