 });

 client.listen('error', function (err) {
     console.error('Connection to Respoke failed.', err);
 });

 // Respoke auth token obtained by your server.
 // This is how you control who can connect to Respoke app.
 // See API docs for POST [base]/tokens
 var tokenId = "XXXX-XXXX-brokered-auth-token-XXXXX";

 // connect to respoke with the token
 client.connect({
     token: tokenId
 });

 // fetch a new token from your server if it expires
 client.listen('disconnect', function (evt) {
     // fetch another token from your server.
     var newTokenId = "XXXX-XXXX-brokered-auth-token2-XXXXX";
