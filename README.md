# Documentation site for Respoke.io

## Working on the docs

```bash
git clone https://github.com/respoke/docs respoke-docs
cd respoke-docs
npm install
npm start
```

The first time you run it, there is a bug where you have to kill it and restart `npm start`. Then it will work correctly. We will fix that soon.

The site is hosted locally at http://localhost:2003/
