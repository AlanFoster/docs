# Documentation site for Respoke.io

**Under construction!**

## Working on the docs

```bash
git clone https://github.com/respoke/docs respoke-docs
cd respoke-docs
npm install
npm run build
```

The site is static, so any web server can serve the files.

Example using [http-server](https://github.com/nodeapps/http-server):

```bash
npm install -g http-server
http-server build
```
